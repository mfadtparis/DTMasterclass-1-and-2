What i (Gijs Gieskes) do:

I am a industrial designer from the Netherlands specializing in the design of electronic devices, for audiovisual use. The devices are often sold as kits but also pre assembled, check my store to see what is currently available.

I also give workshops, exhibitions and demonstartions of my machines, and sometimes (but quite rarely) i work for artists when they need something they cannot make themselves.
